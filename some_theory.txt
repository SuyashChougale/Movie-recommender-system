what is a recommender system?
This system recommends you about things [depending on data] 
It is used by many companies like flipkart youtube  amazon and many more


what are types of recommender system?
1.content based: In this system recommends content based on the content consumed by user
2.collabarative based: In this system recommedns based on data consumed by other users who have similar interests like you
3.hybrid:1+2

Project workfllow:
data -> preprocessing ->model ->website -> deployment


we have 2 datasets which makes work complex .
So,we merged the both datasets and made a common dataset on the basis of title

we also need to reduce the data by removing unuseful columns

'budget' : not useful
'genres' : useful
'homepage':not useful
'id' : useful for representing the movie at the time of deployment
'keywords':useful to compare content of movie
'original_language':unuseful
'original_title':unuseful
'overview':useful
'popularity':unuseful
'production_companies':unuseful
'production_countries':unuseful
'release_date':unuseful
'revenue':unuseful
'runtime':unuseful
'spoken_languages':unuseful
'status':unuseful
'tagline':unuseful
'title':useful
'vote_average':unuseful
'vote_count':unuseful
'movie_id':unuseful
'cast':useful
'crew':useful

Now we have a dataset with required content
we will convert this data only into 3 columns id,title,tags

this tags column will be made by merging all remaing columns
for this we first need to pre process the column
this includes 1. dealing with missing values
2.making the columns into correct format to extract required data

for overview column we just need to split the string

now we need to remove spaces between two words,becuase
take a example there are 2 directors 
sam a and sam b so 
here the tags will be [sam,a] and [sam,b]
so our model will be confused between which sam you are talking about
heance we remove space between words these will create tags as [sama] and [samb]
which can be differentiated


After all this preprocessing now comes the model part
now we have tags
to recommend a movie based on the user selected movie,we need to faind the similar tags
for this we can count the number of words in each text and compare them
but this is not the best method
So here comes vectorization

we convert every tag to a vector and whenever we need to recommend movies we will just recommend nearest movies
vector is nothing but count of each word in the tag 
[you know what I want to tell]
there are different vectorization methods
here we are using bag of words method but you can also search for different methods

now after vectorization,we have to find similarity between them 
here we will use cosine similarity 

After this we need to make recommendation function
In this we will recommend top 10 similar movie names
so in this basically ,we will find index of asked movie then we will find similar movie indices and print there names
